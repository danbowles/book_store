Deep learning systems trained on audio data are a great way for models to learn directly from sound and easily classify what humans are telling them.\r\n\r\nIn this liveProject, you’ll become a data scientist prototyping a speech command system for a medical organization. Your company’s application will allow hospital patients to adjust their room TVs with their voice, and you’ve been tasked with building the core: a machine learning pipeline that can label audio inputs with given command words. You’ll tackle preprocessing and feature engineering methods for audio signals, expand your existing machine learning capabilities with audio data, and get hands-on experience with TensorFlow, Keras, and other powerful Python deep learning tools.\n                            \n                                    This project is designed for learning purposes and is not a complete, production-ready application or solution.\n                                \n            liveProject mentor Stefano Masneri shares what he likes about the Manning liveProject platform.",

A big global competitor has recently set up shop in your region and has been steadily gaining market share, thanks to hyper efficient business process automation in its supply lines. This automation service can receive and read delivery notes ten times faster than the admin staff in your company—and you need to innovate fast to keep your status as the regional market leader. You’ve been tasked with implementing your own company-wide automation solution, using Python to automate your processes. To achieve this, you’ll use Python to iterate through subfolders of your current text-based PDFs and PDF form files and extract field keys and values. You’ll write scripts that can identify field IDs on web forms that correspond to the PDF documents, and automatically populate the web forms with information extracted from your PDFs—no manual data entry needed!

Kubernetes can be a powerful ally in your battle against application complexity, and this free eBook is the perfect place to get started! is a collection of chapters from  by , member of Red Hat’s Cloud Enablement Team. In it, you’ll learn to take your first steps in the world of Kubernetes and how to use it with Docker to control your clusters. You’ll then discover everything you need to use Pods, Kubernetes-managed clusters of containers, including how to manage and keep them healthy. Finally, you’ll see how to implement services to your Pods and expose them to both internal and external clients. When you finish, you’ll have a good overview of Kubernetes and how to get started with it quickly, opening the door for you to continue your learning and bring it into your daily work!",

In order to avoid the need for future refactoring, you’ll use events to communicate between services rather than direct invocation. You’ll use Kubernetes and Knative serverless capabilities and eventing system to control the flow of data through the system and break down services into lean, serverless functions.

Built around the same tenets as calculus, functional programming creates code that’s more stable, more consistent and easier to test. The new JVM language Kotlin has caught the attention of Java and Scala developers, in part because it embraces functional-style programming more naturally than standard Java. Google even supports Kotlin as a first-class Android language because of the simplicity it brings to mobile development. There’s never been a better time to take a close look at this hot new language for functional programming! is a fast, four-chapter introduction designed to give Java programmers a head-start on Kotlin and functional programming. The book sheds light on how functions work in both Kotlin and Java, and how to start implementing them in your code. When you’re done, you’ll have a leg-up on solving programming problems with functional techniques.",

Containing three chapters hand-picked from  by , , and , this free eBook starts by taking you through contract tests that verify your entire system. You’ll discover how Docker helps with your testing and find out how to test your system even when there are components that have yet to be built.

We hope they'll give you a glimpse at how to write clear specifications in a collaborative, purpose-driven way. \r\n\r\nIn  you'll get an overlook of key process patterns essential for using a specification by example approach. Next, you'll go on a whirlwind tour of behavior-driven development and how to implement the basics into your pipeline. Finally, you'll learn how to pick great scenario outlines to use in your documentation. Altogether, you'll have the right frame of mind for writing specifications that improve the quality and usefulness of your software!\r\n\r\nThe clearest way to communicate a software specification is to provide examples of how it should work. Specification by Example is a collaborative method for specifying requirements and tests by collecting and documenting use cases. The method brings four great benefits to your team: it produces living, reliable documentation anyone can read; it defines expectations clearly and makes validation efficient; it reduces rework; and, above all, it lets everyone know that the end product is built exactly for its purpose!\r\n\r\nThis powerful technique is fully documented in  by Gojko Adzic.",

A big global competitor has recently set up shop in your region and has been steadily gaining market share, thanks to hyper efficient business process automation in its supply lines. This automation service can receive and read delivery notes ten times faster than the admin staff in your company—and you need to innovate fast to keep your status as the regional market leader. You’ve been tasked with implementing your own company-wide automation solution, using Python to automate your processes. To achieve this, you’ll use Python to iterate through subfolders of your current text-based PDFs and PDF form files and extract field keys and values. You’ll write scripts that can identify field IDs on web forms that correspond to the PDF documents, and automatically populate the web forms with information extracted from your PDFs—no manual data entry needed! Finally, you’ll prepare a report detailing your conclusions for your manager at PharmaChain.\n                            \n                                    This project is designed for learning purposes and is not a complete, production-ready application or solution.",

You’ll move on to looking at API security concerns from the user’s standpoint when facilitating access control and dealing with sensitive data. Lastly, you’ll explore OAuth 2.0, a security protocol widely used to protect APIs from small startups all the way to large-scale providers including Google and Facebook.
